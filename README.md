# EX.-NO-1-D-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-VIGENERE-CIPHER

## AIM:
  To implement the Vigenere Cipher substitution technique using C program.
  
## ALGORITHM:
  STEP-1: Arrange the alphabets in row and column of a 26*26 matrix.
  
  STEP-2: Circulate the alphabets in each row to position left such that the first letter is attached to last.
 
  STEP-3: Repeat this process for all 26 rows and construct the final key matrix.
  
  STEP-4: The keyword and the plain text is read from the user.
  
  STEP-5: The characters in the keyword are repeated sequentially so as to match with that of the plain text.
  
  STEP-6: Pick the first letter of the plain text and that of the keyword as the row  indices and column indices respectively.
  
  STEP-7: The junction character where these two meet forms the cipher character.
  
  STEP-8: Repeat the above steps to generate the entire cipher text.
  
## PROGRAM:

## OUTPUT:

## RESULT:
  Thus the Vigenere Cipher substitution technique had been implemented successfully.
